# Creating 3 Organizational Units using PowerShell Script:

This project demonstrates how to use PowerShell to create three Organizational Units (OUs) in Active Directory: **HR**, **Marketing**, and **Finance**.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- PowerShell
- Active Directory Module (RSAT Tools)

## ðŸ“œ Script Overview
```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Define the OU names
$ouList = @("HR", "Marketing", "Finance")

# Loop to create each OU
foreach ($ou in $ouList) {
    New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name $ou -Path "DC=far,DC=local" -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false
    Write-Host "âœ… Created OU: $ou"
}

Write-Host "`nðŸŽ‰ All Organizational Units created successfully!"
```
## ðŸŽ“ What I Learned
This hands-on project helped me strengthen my skills in PowerShell scripting and Active Directory management. Specifically, I learned how to:

Automate administrative tasks using PowerShell in a Windows Server environment.

Utilize the New-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet to efficiently create and manage Organizational Units (OUs).

Write, structure, and execute PowerShell scripts tailored for domain-based environments.

Apply best practices for designing and organizing Active Directory OU hierarchies.
